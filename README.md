Project Abstract      
          The patient is transported to the hospital as soon as possible by ambulance. However, in a city with a lot of people or traffic, an ambulance struck the traffic without being noticed by the traffic police to make room for it. The likelihood that the patient will survive increases when they are brought to the hospital early. We need some kind of technology or system that tells the traffic police that an ambulance is coming this way so that they can clear the way for it and the ambulance can get to the hospital quickly. We introduce an Ambulance Alerting System to address this issue, which will be able to transmit ambulance information to traffic police
